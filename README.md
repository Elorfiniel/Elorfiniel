## About Me

Hello there! I'm **Elorfiniel**, a passionate deep learning practitioner and a graduate student pursuing his master's degree at **Institution of Computing Technology, Beijing**.  My current interests span across computer vision and computer graphics. Specifically, I'm interested in **gaze estimation**, 3D reconstruction, ray tracing, diffusion models, and generative AI.

In addition to my research, I also enjoy **graphic design** and **photography**. You can find more about the posters and illustrations I've done on [Zcool](https://elorfiniel.zcool.com.cn/). Also, feel free to check out several of my photos on [EyeEm](https://www.eyeem.com/u/lightmightnight).
